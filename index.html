                                            Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family
                                            Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller and shorter-necked than swans and geese,
                                            which are members of the same family. Divided among several subfamilies, they
                                            are a form taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all
                                            descendants of a single common ancestral species), since swans and geese are not
                                            considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh
                                            water and sea water.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with
                                            similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules and coots.
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h5>Etymology</h5>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The word duck comes from Old English dūce 'diver', a derivative of the verb
                                            *dūcan 'to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive', because
                                            of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare
                                            with Dutch duiken and German tauchen 'to dive'.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            This word replaced Old English ened/ænid 'duck', possibly to avoid confusion
                                            with other words, such as ende 'end' with similar forms. Other Germanic
                                            languages still have similar words for duck, for example, Dutch eend, German
                                            Ente and Norwegian and. The word ened/ænid was inherited from
                                            Proto-Indo-European; cf. Latin anas "duck", Lithuanian ántis 'duck', Ancient
                                            Greek νῆσσα/νῆττα (nēssa/nētta) 'duck', and Sanskrit ātí 'water bird', among
                                            others.
                                        </p>

                                            A duckling is a young duck in downy plumage or baby duck, but in the food
                                            trade a young domestic duck which has just reached adult size and bulk and its
                                            meat is still fully tender, is sometimes labelled as a duckling.

                                            A male is called a drake and the female is called a duck, or in ornithology a
                                            hen.

                                            <h5>Taxonomy</h5>

                                        <p>
                                            All ducks belong to the biological order Anseriformes, a group that contains the
                                            ducks, geese and swans, as well as the screamers, and the magpie goose. All
                                            except the screamers belong to the biological family Anatidae. Within the
                                            family, ducks are split into a variety of subfamilies and 'tribes'. The number
                                            and composition of these subfamilies and tribes is the cause of considerable
                                            disagreement among taxonomists. Some base their decisions on morphological
                                            characteristics, others on shared behaviours or genetic studies. The
                                            number of suggested subfamilies containing ducks ranges from two to five.
                                            The significant level of hybridisation that occurs among wild ducks complicates
                                            efforts to tease apart the relationships between various species.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            In most modern classifications, the so-called 'true ducks' belong to the
                                            subfamily Anatinae, which is further split into a varying number of tribes.
                                            The largest of these, the Anatini, contains the 'dabbling' or 'river' ducks
                                            &mdash; named for their method of feeding primarily at the surface of fresh
                                            water. The 'diving ducks', also named for their primary feeding method, make
                                            up the tribe Aythyini. The 'sea ducks' of the tribe Mergini are diving ducks
                                            which specialise on fish and shellfish and spend a majority of their lives in
                                            saltwater. The tribe Oxyurini contains the 'stifftails', diving ducks
                                            notable for their small size and stiff, upright tails.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            A number of other species called ducks are not considered to be 'true ducks',
                                            and are typically placed in other subfamilies or tribes. The whistling ducks are
                                            assigned either to a tribe (Dendrocygnini) in the subfamily Anatinae or the
                                            subfamily Anserinae, or to their own subfamily (Dendrocygninae) or family
                                            (Dendrocyganidae). The freckled duck of Australia is either the sole
                                            member of the tribe Stictonettini in the subfamily Anserinae, or in its own
                                            family, the Stictonettinae. The shelducks make up the tribe Tadornini in the
                                            family Anserinae in some classifications, and their own subfamily,
                                            Tadorninae, in others, while the steamer ducks are either placed in the
                                            family Anserinae in the tribe Tachyerini or lumped with the shelducks in the
                                            tribe Tadorini. The perching ducks make up in the tribe Cairinini in the
                                            subfamily Anserinae in some classifications, while that tribe is eliminated in
                                            other classifications and its members assigned to the tribe Anatini. The
                                            torrent duck is generally included in the subfamily Anserinae in the monotypic
                                            tribe Merganettini, but is sometimes included in the tribe Tadornini.
                                            The pink-eared duck is sometimes included as a true duck either in the tribe
                                            Anatini or the tribe Malacorhynchini, and other times is included with

                                        <p>
                                            The overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and they are also
                                            relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The
                                            body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. The
                                            bill is usually broad and contains serrated pectens, which are particularly well
                                            defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the
                                            bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well
                                            developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic
                                            species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the
                                            flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing
                                            muscles. Three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many
                                            species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out
                                            protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult
                                            typically precedes migration.

                                            The drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is
                                            moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the "eclipse" plumage.
                                            Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there
                                            are exceptions such as the paradise shelduck of New Zealand, which is both
                                            strikingly sexually dimorphic and in which the female's plumage is brighter than
                                            that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the
                                            female. Female ducks have evolved to have a corkscrew shaped vagina to prevent
                                            rape.

                                        <p>
                                            Ducks have a cosmopolitan distribution, and are found on every continent except
                                            Antarctica. Several species manage to live on subantarctic islands, including
                                            South Georgia and the Auckland Islands. Ducks have reached a number of
                                            isolated oceanic islands, including the Hawaiian Islands, Micronesia and the
                                            Galápagos Islands, where they are often vagrants and less often
                                            residents. A handful are endemic to such far-flung islands.

                                            Some duck species, mainly those breeding in the temperate and Arctic Northern
                                            Hemisphere, are migratory; those in the tropics are generally not. Some ducks,
                                            particularly in Australia where rainfall is erratic, are nomadic, seeking out
                                            the temporary lakes and pools that form after localised heavy rain.

                                            Ducks eat food sources such as grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, small
                                            amphibians, worms, and small molluscs.

                                            Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can
                                            reach by up-ending without completely submerging. Along the edge of the
                                            bill, there is a comb-like structure called a pecten. This strains the water
                                            squirting from the side of the bill and traps any food. The pecten is also used
                                            to preen feathers and to hold slippery food items.

                                            Diving ducks and sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more
                                            easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have
                                            more difficulty taking off to fly.

                                            A few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and

                                            The others have the characteristic wide flat bill adapted to dredging-type jobs

                                            The Guardian published an article advising that ducks should not be fed with
                                            bread because it damages the health of the ducks and pollutes waterways.

                                            Ducks generally only have one partner at a time, although the partnership
                                            usually only lasts one year. Larger species and the more sedentary species
                                            (like fast-river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last numerous
                                            years. Most duck species breed once a year, choosing to do so in favourable
                                            conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons). Ducks also tend to make a nest before
                                            breeding, and, after hatching, lead their ducklings to water. Mother ducks are
                                            very caring and protective of their young, but may abandon some of their
                                            ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of (such
                                            as nesting in an enclosed courtyard) or are not prospering due to genetic
                                            defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or disease.
                                            Ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few eggs
                                            hatch after the mother has abandoned the nest and led her ducklings to
                                            water.

                                            "quack". In general, ducks make a range of calls, including whistles,
                                            cooing, yodels and grunts. For example, the scaup &mdash; which are diving ducks
                                            &mdash; make a noise like "scaup" (hence their name). Calls may be loud
                                            displaying calls or quieter contact calls.

                                            Ducks have many predators. Ducklings are particularly vulnerable, since their
                                            inability to fly makes them easy prey not only for predatory birds but also for
                                            large fish like pike, crocodilians, predatory testudines such as the alligator
                                            snapping turtle, and other aquatic hunters, including fish-eating birds such as
                                            herons. Ducks' nests are raided by land-based predators, and brooding females
                                            may be caught unaware on the nest by mammals, such as foxes, or large birds,
                                            such as hawks or owls.

                                            Adult ducks are fast fliers, but may be caught on the water by large aquatic
                                            predators including big fish such as the North American muskie and the European
                                            pike. In flight, ducks are safe from all but a few predators such as humans and
                                            the peregrine falcon, which uses its speed and strength to catch ducks.

                                            waterfowl. Neolithic hunters in locations as far apart as the Caribbean,
                                            Scandinavia, Egypt, Switzerland, and China relied on ducks as a
                                            source of protein for some or all of the year. Archeological evidence shows
                                            that Māori people in New Zealand hunted the flightless Finsch's duck, possibly
                                            to extinction, though rat predation may also have contributed to its fate. A
                                            similar end awaited the Chatham duck, a species with reduced flying capabilities
                                            which went extinct shortly after its island was colonised by Polynesian
                                            settlers. It is probable that duck eggs were gathered by Neolithic
                                            hunter-gathers as well, though hard evidence of this is uncommon.

                                            In many areas, wild ducks (including ducks farmed and released into the wild)
                                            are hunted for food or sport, by shooting, or formerly by being trapped
                                            using duck decoys. Because an idle floating duck or a duck squatting on land
                                            cannot react to fly or move quickly, "a sitting duck" has come to mean "an easy
                                            target". These ducks may be contaminated by pollutants such as PCBs.

                                            <h6>Domestication</h6>

                                        <p>
                                            Ducks have many economic uses, being farmed for their meat, eggs, and feathers
                                            (particularly their down). Approximately 3 billion ducks are slaughtered each
                                            year for meat worldwide. They are also kept and bred by aviculturists and
                                            often displayed in zoos. Almost all the varieties of domestic ducks are
                                            descended from the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), apart from the Muscovy duck
                                            (Cairina moschata). The Call duck is another example of a domestic duck
                                            breed. Its name comes from its original use established by hunters, as a decoy
                                            to attract wild mallards from the sky, into traps set for them on the ground.
                                            The call duck is the world's smallest domestic duck breed, as it weighs less
                                            than 1 kg (2.2 lb).

                                            Ducks appear on several coats of arms, including the coat of arms of Lubāna
                                            (Latvia) and the coat of arms of Föglö (Åland).

                                            <h6>Cultural references</h6>

                                        <p>
                                            In 2002, psychologist Richard Wiseman and colleagues at the University of
                                            Hertfordshire, UK, finished a year-long LaughLab experiment, concluding that of
                                            all animals, ducks attract the most humor and silliness; he said, "If you're
                                            going to tell a joke involving an animal, make it a duck." The word "duck"
                                            may have become an inherently funny word in many languages, possibly because
                                            ducks are seen as silly in their looks or behavior. Of the many ducks in
                                            fiction, many are cartoon characters, such as Walt Disney's Donald Duck, and
                                            Warner Bros.' Daffy Duck. Howard the Duck started as a comic book character in
                                            1973 and was made into a movie in 1986.

                                        <p>
                                            The 1992 Disney film The Mighty Ducks, starring Emilio Estevez, chose the duck
                                            as the mascot for the fictional youth hockey team who are protagonists of the
                                            movie, based on the duck being described as a fierce fighter. This led to the
                                            duck becoming the nickname and mascot for the eventual National Hockey League
                                            professional team of the Anaheim Ducks, who were founded with the name the
                                            Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The duck is also the nickname of the
                                            University of Oregon sports teams as well as the Long Island Ducks minor league
                                            baseball team.
